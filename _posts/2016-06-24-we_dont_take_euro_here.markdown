I studied in England for a year when I was 19, and while I was surprised by the results of the Brexit vote, in retrospect, there were many moments, even in 2005 that pointed to the xenophobia that seems to have given the winning edge to the leave campaign. 

The UK has never fully embraced the EU; especially it’s common currency. I remember a time some friends and I were taking a road trip form England to Scotland and stopped for a coffee at a roadside restaurant about 40 minutes drive from the Scottish border. The middle-aged woman at the counter was very friendly when she heard my American accent, she asked about my visit and where we were heading. 

“Edinburgh, I told her, how is it? “

“I don’t know” she said, I’ve never been there.”

I was thinking about how odd it was that someone who lived here their whole life had never traveled an hour up the road to one of Europe’s most beautiful cities, when 3 French truck drivers entered the line behind me. 

It was obvious they had been driving all day, probably from France, another EU country, but when they tried to pay for their meal in Europe’s single currency the Euro, the same woman who had been so cordial to me abruptly turned to the truckers, and in a patronizing tone said “WE DON”T TAKE EURO HERE!”

Even as an American, I found that if I had wanted to stay in England after my school term was finished I would have to marry a British person. Regardless of the fact that I was graduating from one of the most well respected conservatories in the country, and even though I had tentative job offers, the only way to stay was to become British.   

Ultimately, after trying many different ways to stay (short of a fake marriage) I returned to my home country of New York City! And I am very glad that I did. 

While I still considered myself fortunate for the experience to have lived in England,
I found opportunities waiting for me in the USA that I hadn’t seen before my trip across the pond. 

It seems many foreign-born workers, especially in London’s tech sector, may soon be facing the same predicament. I’m sure that if these workers leave they will return to their home countries, or other parts of Europe and make those places better by building on the experience they’ve had in the UK. 

Unfortunately this brain drain may leave Britain more British, but perhaps much less able to hold itself up as an international magnet for innovation.
