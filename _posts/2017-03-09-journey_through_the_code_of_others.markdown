I spent most of this week completing a code challenge from a prospective employer. This was actually the first code challenge I'd ever received, and so, when I first got it, I was a bit naive about what exactly it would entail. 

I first looked at the simple PNG file that displayed what the finished app should look like. ...a simple ToDo list. 
Having made todo list apps with both AngularJS and Sinatra I felt pretty confident that I would be able to quickly build out the features I was asked to work on.  ....then, I opened up the code. 

I was surprised to see how an app that looked so familiar to me on the surface could seem so alien to me under the hood. This ToDo app was built on a React framework (something I'm still new to) and also had no database to save and store the data. It took me a long time to figure out how the server was connected to the front end, and how to understand which files were dependent on which other files. 

When I finally figured out which of the react components was the Parent component things started to click. But I spend the first few hours just picking away at the code trying to understand what each line did. 

I was able to make good progress on this code challenge and I'm feeling good about it now. 

I also leaned a valuable lesson, that reading and editing the code of others is sometimes more challenging than writing your own code from scratch.
