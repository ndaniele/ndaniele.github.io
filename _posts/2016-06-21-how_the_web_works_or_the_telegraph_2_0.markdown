"The miracle of high speed wire communication is common today" 

A resoundingly modern sentiment, even though this quote is from a 1943 industrial film touting the benefits of the modern Telegraph and Telephone. 

It's important to remember that while the internet is the dominant form of high-speed communication today, it is built on principals that date back over 100 years to the invention of the telegraph. 

Understanding web fundamentals doesn't have to be a foray into a mysterious world of microchips and towers of servers. It can just be a natural extension of understanding the way that people have communicated over distances for a very long time. 

In researching this post I came across archival footage of instructions for Telegram and Telephone operators circa 1943. It's interesting to see how the great, great, grandfather of the Internet, the Telegraph, used fundamentally many of the same systems and protocols that the modern Internet is built on. 

When you are just starting to peak behind the veil of how the Internet works it can seem confusing and overwhelming. It may help to picture yourself as one of the telephone/telegraph operators in this old instructional video.

You've gotten a job in a black and white office and you're looking at a giant switchboard. It’s you're job to make the correct connection, so that the caller on one end can be connected to the receiver on the other end. ...Not so overwhelming or mysterious after all. 

Computers perform this same task by connecting to other computers, in the same way that telephone operators used to connect callers to networks. 

Machines don't speak English …at least not as their first language. 
Telecommunications pioneers got around this with a 10 digit “phone number” (555-555-5555). 

Computers also use numbers to communicate over the Internet. “Computer numbers” are called IP addresses, and each website has one. But since it’s easier for you as a human to remember a website’s name (www.website.com) as opposed to it’s IP address (192.168.0.255 – imagine that as some company’s slogan) the computer’s first task is to find the IP address that is associated with the website you want to visit. 

It all starts when you (the user) enter a web address into your browser (www.oldtimevideos.com) your computer sends this address out to a special kind of computer called a server. 

This server checks it's memory to see if it knows the code (or IP address) of the website you want, if it doesn't it sends a message to another server to get the correct address. Once the server has the correct code it sends this code back to your computer.

-	This stage in the process is similar to calling the operator - 

YOU: “I need the number for Jon Smith in Des Moines, IW

OLD TIMEY OPERATOR “one moment please
…that number is (555-555-5555)

YOU: “thank you”

- for your computer - 

YOUR COMPUTER: "I need the IP address for www.jonsmith.com"

SERVER: "One moment please… that address is 192.168.0.255


Now that your computer has the IP address, it sends that IP address to a “host server”, which is a special kind of computer that holds all the files that make up the website you want to visit.  The host server knows that the IP address you've given it is equal to the website you want to see (much like an area code and phone number are associated with a person you want to speak to). The host server accesses the files that make up that website, and sends those files to your computer. 

And just like that a connection is made. And you are interacting with a website. 

Not so different from how telephone and telegraph operators of old used to connect the world. They would be proud you’re building on their legacy!
