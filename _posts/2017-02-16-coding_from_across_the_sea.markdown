I've been working as a Learn Expert at Flatiron School, mentoring students who are on the same course that I recently graduated from. 

The works is great, I've really enjoyed helping people learn to love to code, and helping them through the concepts. 

Recently I worked a shift until 1am (Eastern Time) ...I thought that working the ghost shift would be easy, but what I hadn't remembered was that just because it was late at night for me, it was just the early morning in Asia. 

I ended up taking a bunch of questions from the other side of the world! Trying to explain these complex coding concepts to someone from another culture was a new experience for me, and it really helped me to hone in on the specifics of the code that I was looking at. 

It was a great experience!
