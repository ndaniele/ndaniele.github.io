First let me say that I really enjoyed working on this project. It was a welcome change from the previous lab, which I found laborious (that being said, I was working solo, and I would have rather worked with a partner on it – there were just so many damn files to code) 

This lab was great! I got the instant gratification of building something that works, and the first time my cli gem delivered headlines that I hadn’t read on the website yet was really exciting! It really worked! It did tell me about the top tech headlines! 

That being said I could not have done this without significant help from the learn experts, especially @mendelb who really helped me hone my scraping code. 

Special thanks to Avi for his video of building a gem, which I used as a code along.
I could not have done it without this video.  

Working on this lab I realized that I am becoming more literate as a programmer, but I am still overwhelmed, and frozen (think dear in the headlights) when I look at a blank sublime file and have to figure out how to build a program from scratch. 

I feel like my old Italian great grandmother (god rest her soul) who could understand English, but not really speak it. I was able to follow along with Avi and understand what the code was doing and why, but if I had to come up with it on my own I never would have completed the lab. 

I hope to get better at that part. However, it was comforting to hear Avi say that looking at a blank page is intimidating (and if a veteran programmer like him feels that way  - I don’t feel so bad) 

Again. I really enjoyed making this gem, and I’m happy that I have a gem that actually does something and delivers modestly useful information to a user via a CLI. But I also realize how far I have to go, because as of this moment I am not capable of building such a thing on my own from scratch.
