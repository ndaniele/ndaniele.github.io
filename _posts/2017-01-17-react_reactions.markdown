I'm taking advantage of the react program on Learn. It's a great curriculum, and it has served as a good way to review my JavaScript skills. 

After building my final app with a ruby-rails back end and an AngularJS front-end, it's an exciting step to apply those skills to the more component based React architecture. 

I'm just getting into understanding the Virtual DOM structure. I can appreciate the efficiency of the concept, but I'm not yet as confident in React as I am in AngularJS. 

Whenever I am starting a new code adventure (learning a new tool or language) I like to spend time reading about underlying ideas in the language. Understanding what the tools I am using were originally designed to do always helps me get a better handle on how to use them for my own applications. 

Look out for more in depth posts on this as I'll be undertaking more react coding exercises and eventually making a react front end for my "Aggregator" App.
