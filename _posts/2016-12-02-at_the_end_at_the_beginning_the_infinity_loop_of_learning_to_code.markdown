Here I am, finally. Writing the final required blog post of the Flatiron School Full Stack Web Developer program. 

I have just spent the past 2 weeks building my rails/angular final project. It has been an intense 14 days. Lots of late nightâ€™s googling solutions to problems, lots of reviewing Learn.co lessons, and stackoverflow pages. Lots of breaking code, fixing code, and breaking it again. But now, having a complete (if not fully polished) app. I feel good! 

I also feel like I am just at the beginning of learning how to be a developer. Although I have been able to build an app that does what I want it to do (more or less) this process has showed me how much more there still is to learn. I now have new questions that I never could have even formulated a month or so ago. How do I bring an app from development to production? What's the best way to add a devise front end to an angularjs framework? Are there easier ways to refactor my angular services? Should I be building more custom directives, or try to make due with what comes "in the box". 

I feel like I am standing on a diving board about to jump into the pool of real full stack web development. In this moment I feel very grateful to the Flatiron School, and all my instructors and fellow dev students, because now, with their help, at least I know how to swim.
