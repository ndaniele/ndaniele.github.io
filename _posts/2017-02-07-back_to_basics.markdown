I've recently taken a job as a Learn Expert at the Flatiron School, the same code boot camp I graduated from just a month or so ago. In preparation for this new job, which includes assisting students in solving code challenges and understanding coding concepts, I have gone back to the earliest lesions in the Flatiron curriculum and I have really enjoyed it. 

After months of building apps with SQL, and ActiveRecord, it has been a nice change to focus on the core syntax and functionality of JavaScript and Ruby. I feel like I'm having a chance to get to know these great languages all over again, and really appreciate their efficiency. 

I'm looking forward to being able to cover these topics in detail with learn students, not only because I want to give back to the school that helped me to become a developer, but also because by teaching these concepts I know that they will become even more ingrained in my mind. I'm excited to take this next step towards becoming a better programmer.
