When I first stated the JS section of the learn curriculum I felt a sinking feeling. Something along the lines of the feeling you get when you have to stop being a Senior in High School and become a freshman all over again in college. 
I felt like I had just had a great time learning the ins and outs of Ruby and Rails. I had spent months with these languages and now I had to train my eye to read the much more heavily punctuated and much more idiosyncratic JavaScript. 

It took be about a month to work through the JS curriculum on Learn, but now, having completed the JS additions to my Rails app, I am back to feeling on top. 

The hardest part about JS for me is the syntax. Remembering all of those “;” and checking to make sure all of my end brackets line up the way they are supposed to. 

I added some JS functions to my app, which was a bit of a chore, but really helped me understand why this language is so great and what it brings to the table that Ruby and Rails leave off. 

It is great to have this knowledge of back-end and front-end development. I feel much more empowered as a developer now that I have these skills. JS helped me turn a clunky, multi-page Rails App into a sleek(ish) one-page app with a JS front end.  …Can’t wait to see what new features Angular will bring to the mix.
