This week i've taken my first crack at accessing API's for a real client/freelance dev gig. 
It has been a fun way to dig into my API tool kit, I've been using Postman to make test API calls and reading throught a lot of documentation and watching videos to fully understand what is required to make the best use of the API's in this project. 

All was going smoothly unitl I came up against the SalesForce API. I can't comment on how difficult or easy this API is to make calls to becuase I couldn't manage to get an API key or Secret to even begin trying to access it. 

After hours of trying to get the Key and Secret on my own by opening up a Salesforce developer account, googleing, watching videos, and reading articles, I realized that the probelm was not my fault! (always a nice realization) I realized that the client had provided incorrect log in information for the Salesforce account, and so I could not gain access to the features that the client thought I should be able to gain access to. I passed the problem, along with a detailed error report to the man who contacted me about this gig in the first place, and he passed them onto the client. 

It's good to know that sometimes when you are hitting a brick wall in programming it really isn't you. ...at least sometimes :)
