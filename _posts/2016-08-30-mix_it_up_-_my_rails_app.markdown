…or why programing is fun and creative! 

After months of lessons geared at gaining a basic understanding of code in general and ruby in particular I feel like I have finally turned a corner and am beginning to understand the tools of the coding trade and use them to create projects I am passionate about. 

My rails assessment app, "Mix", grew out of an interest I had in creating an app that would help groups of people quickly aggregate opinion around particular questions, and a my need to check to see if I truly understood the lessons I had covered in the Rails unit. 

I began building this app when I was about 2/3rds done with the rails unit. A time when I had hit a wall. I felt like I understood the individual labs, but couldn't put them into any meaningful context. I decided not to wait until I had completed all the labs, and to simply start building my own personal rails assessment app to check my understanding. 

I was instantly surprised at how quickly I was able to get my basic models connected and my app up and running. I think the what helped me most in building this app was that, as the designer, I had a very clear idea of exactly what I wanted the app to do and what features I would eventually build into it. 

I sometimes find this kind of clarity illusive in the learn labs, as many labs are just adding features to labs that were started earlier, or many labs are for apps that I have never seen the equivalent of in the real world. With my "Mix" app, I knew the functions it needed to perform, and I enjoyed spending days building and refactoring it so that it did exactly what I wanted it to do. 

I also finally got a truly complete understanding of how databases relate to models, views, and HTML calls. ...Something I thought I understood before, but definitely not as well as I do now, after building my app. 

In one of the video tutorials Avi said to think about your app either from the database up or the html down. I found it very useful to work form the database up. Once I had all my tables created and models connected, I relied on my rails console to check the relationships, tweak them when needed, and try out code that I would build into my models. From then it was easy to "wire" everything through the controllers.

Building this app also brought clarity to me around the functionality of the MVC architecture. I’ve learned the importance of running “rake routes” on any app I’m working on (mine or a learn lab). To me the routes look like a circuit breaker, and that's how I have come to understand and visualize them. I see routes as circuits that run the structure of a site, they can be turned on or off in “config/routes”, and they get wired to views and models via the controller (which I like to imagine as a mixing board). 

I could go on and on about all the different ways building my app has helped me to fully visualize and translate rails app architecture into language I understand. But the point is that after building my app, I no longer see coding as an abstract practice. I realize that it is very similar to the work I used to do with film and video set ups and audio mixing. The difference is that instead of digging through a box of components and cable to create something, I can build what I need by typing lines of code. Very liberating! Very exciting!
