I never had any interest in coding or learning to code until about 9 months ago. At the time I was living in the small, isolated country of Bhutan. A nation that has made its reputation on being "the last Shangri-La", where monks light incense at high mountain shrines, and farmers tend the fields their ancestors tended for generations. Not a country synonymous with STEM. 

I was there to initiate the Filmmakers Without Boarders Fellowship program in Bhutan. For the previous 5 years I had worked for acclaimed documentary filmmaker Albert Maysles at the Maysles Documentary Center in upper Manhattan, and when I was offered the chance to help introduce this filmmaking fellowship into the world's last Buddhist kingdom I jumped at the opportunity, it seemed like a natural progression of my work in documentary film.

Arriving in the remote Himalayan kingdom was an experience like no other. The small plane I had boarded in the bustling Nepalese capital, Kathmandu flew over high, rocky peaks on its short 90-minute trip to the Bhutanese capital, Thimphu. The difference between the two countries became apparent as soon as we entered Bhutanese air space. The sprawl of Kathmandu ended, and over the mountains that separate the two countries was Bhutan. A rugged landscape populated by few houses, and fewer people. Landing at the one room airport (Bhutan's only airport for international travelers) I was surprised by how small-scale and low-tech everything was. 

Once on the ground, the distances seemed greater, and the countryside even more sparsely populated. …There are still many communities in Bhutan that are a 3 day's drive from the capital city, and then another day or more of a hike into remote mountain forests.

As I began my teaching fellowship, I found that much of the technology that I take for granted was simply not available in Bhutan. I had to make routine trips to one of the only luxury hotels in Thimphu to get a "decent" Internet connection, and even there, files that would take minutes to download or upload in the States could easily take days! ...Fortunately I was able to strike up a friendship with some of the hotel staff, who would let me leave my computer plugged in and downloading on a counter by the coffee machine (one of only a handful of coffee machines in Bhutan) overnight. 

I knew going into the fellowship that I had signed up to come to a very remote place, but as my year in Bhutan went on, I began to see the overwhelming lack of technology not as a retreat, but as an impediment. Not only to me and other frustrated foreigners, but to my Bhutanese friends as well, whose attempts to collaborate and interact with potential colleagues outside of Bhutan were made practically impossible due to poor internet connectivity, and a lack of access to computers. 

I began to see technology and it's related fields not as some novel experiment a few "techies" in California were doing (and somehow making billions on), but as a sea change on a similar scale to the industrial revolution.

I realized that technology, the internet, and those who program it (coders!) were on the crest of a wave that was sweeping across the world, "disrupting" older, established ways of doing almost everything, and leaving a more modern, greener world in it's wake. A boon to nations with the capacity to take advantage of it, and a distant shimmering and seemingly unattainable rainbow to nations (like Bhutan) too small to fully participate. The image that comes to mind is Soran desperately trying to catch the energy ribbon in the film Star Trek Generations.

I began to feel that like Soran, my Bhutanese hosts and I were being left behind in this change. I realized that even though the Internet and I were born at about the same time, I knew very little about my age-mate, and the innovations it had spurred. I began watching the tech program Click on the BBC (one of the few channels I received on the 10inch Indian-made television that came with my apartment) and it felt like everyone, everywhere was being swept up in this tech revolution.

I began to feel a bit illiterate, like there was a huge part of the modern world that I simply had never been formally introduced to. I saw my Bhutanese friends struggling to take advantage of what technology they could, and I realized how comparatively easy it would be for me, an American from New York City, to become more tech-knowledgeable. I realized that if my Bhutanese friends were in my position they wouldn't hesitate to jump on-board this wave of technology, and I began to feel obligated to do the same. 

Totally by chance I had met up with a friend from high school shortly before going to Bhutan. He had been a teacher in the NYC public school system, but had recently left that job to become a programmer. At the time he was working at the same coding school he had gone to, The Flatiron school. I reached out to him and he connected me to the learn platform which eventually lead me to enroll in the web developer course. 

My main interest is in the emerging Internet of Things, as well as in virtual/agumented reality. I love the idea of a future full of "smart" devices, where technology may become more ubiquitous, but also much more seamlessly integrated into our lives. I’m also impressed by the tech world's interest in pushing for greener technologies, and future technologies like commercial space flight. 

I've spent my entire adult life working the arts, and I feel that programing is a natural extension of that work. Coding is a very creative pursuit. Moreover, I feel that tech-knowledge in general, and programming in particular, are simply prerequisite for fully participating in the world, across all fields. I'm glad that I am learning to surf this new wave. I hope my Bhutanese friends, and people around the developing world are giving a chance to do the same.
