I just completed a road trip from the Northeast to Austin, TX for my cousin's wedding. I was hoping this trip would be a nice break from the world of coding that I have been immersed in over the past months, but instead I came across a United States of Coding! 

Programmers were everywhere I went. 

It was a chilly Wednesday in late September when my dog, “Ladydog” and I pulled out of my parents garage in central Connecticut to begin a nearly 4,000 mile round trip to Austin, TX. The plan was simple, drive through a good slice of Middle America and stop at some interesting cities along the way. I didn’t expect that each city would have so much tech development going on in them. The following is a brief description of what happened in each of those stops. 

In Pittsburgh, PA I shared an AirBnB with a programmer who works for a maker space in Boston. We explored a bit of Pittsburgh together, and he told me about how his company had been sending him there for the past few weeks to work with a team at Carnegie Mellon University who was working on making better 3D Printers, and writing code to allow you to turn any idea into a printable product. 

In Louisville, KY I met former New-Yorkers who had relocated from the outer boroughs of the Big Apple to live in the heart of the hip, tech-centered district in Louisville. Some were doing remote work for big companies. They expressed how freeing it was to work from anywhere, and be able to live wherever they wanted. 

My next stop on the way to Texas was Little Rock, AK. I wasn't expecting much from this sleepy southern capital, but I again ended up sharing an AirBnB with a computer programmer. ...After 8 hours in a car it was nice to be greeted with friendly conversation about the idiosyncrasies of JavaScript and discuss the merits of Ruby and Rails. 

My next day's drive took me to Austin, where it seemed that tech was king and programmers were everywhere. It was odd to be so far from the Northeast and still feel like I was in some neighborhood in BKLYN. The entire city of Austin seemed to be full of people who were doing something in tech, or knew someone who was. Every time I met a new person in Austin and told them I was completing a coding course they assumed that I was coming to work in their tech sector. 
It was nice to see such a thriving and diverse community of techies. 

I stayed in Austin for 5 days and then began my long drive back to New England with my faithful dog, “Ladydog”, as my car companion (she doesn't do any of the driving, but she's good company all the same). I had thought that this trip would be a chance to get away from the world of programming, but instead I found that programming seemed to have taken over the world. 

I have heard so many personal stories from friends of mine who are also taking the opportunity to learn to code and get involved in this expanding world of programmers. My trip made me feel like I am part of a nation-wide (perhaps world-wider) phenomenon of people who bettering themselves and their communities through tech. And I am excited to be a part of that!
